Steps for programming:-

 Changing Z to C drive and directory to 8086

z:\>  mount c c:\
z:>   c:
c:\>  cd 8086
c:\8086> 

Editor: This is used to open the editor for entering code
Step1: 

c:\8086> masm filename.asm

Step2:
Linking: This is used to link the asm file to obj file

c:\8086> link filename.obj

The obj file is executed to generate the executable file 

c:\8086> debug filename.exe

-g : This is used for entire program execution 

-t : line by line execution 

-u : unassemble the code 

-q : To exit the debugger 

-d<adress of segment>:0

Eg: d 076b:0

Basic 8086 Program Structure 

Any 8086 program consists of two parts:
1. Directives (For the assembler)
2. Instruction and Values (For the compiler)
